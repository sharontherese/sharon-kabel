This essay is a summary of my research methods that led to those findings. 

In 1980, the Vatican published a list of 479 names - the 479 council periti at the Second Vatican Council. The list looked like this: 

![](/uploads/periti/index_peritorum.png "The list of periti as recorded by the Vatican")

So, each name was recorded as: 

> Lastname Latinized_first_name, AbbreviatedOrder
> 
> I, II, III, IV

My original plan was to OCR (optical character recognition) the document, copy and paste the list, and do some relaxing research deep dives into some of the periti. 

Unfortunately, from a researcher’s perspective, the formatting of this list renders this impossible. If I ran the list through OCR, the formatting prevented me from copying and pasting the names in a sequential way. The lack of the ‘vernacular’ first name meant I could not easily research by full name. In fact, I could not be sure what the first and last names actually were. There was no syntactical delineation between the names, except for a comma to set apart the (latinized and abbreviated) religious order. 

This list of names felt like a barrier to research itself, and I can't resist fixing a list.
