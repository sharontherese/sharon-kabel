# abstract

Although the Second Vatican Council (1962-5) is the most important religious event of the last century, it remains curiously underdocumented. It is surprisingly difficult to have an accurate and comprehensive picture of who was present, what was said, what was done, and what was meant. Even a complete list of the Council Fathers, the voting members of the Council, is difficult to find. Even more mysterious are the periti, the theological assistants to the Council itself and/or particular Council Fathers. These men, priests and religious, were selected for their expertise in numerous aspects of theology and history. They would go on to become university presidents, newspaper editors, radio directors, bishops, saints, criminals, and in one instance, pope. The amount they wrote in their careers is nearly immeasurable, and the more they are studied, the more we find their direct influence on the inception, discussion, revision, and promulgation of the Council documents themselves. For the first time, here is a list of the 479 council periti as reported by the Vatican, 49 private periti - with over 30 data points for each peritus. Those data points include 7 author identifiers, 7 biographical identifiers, and 11 points of general interest. While I have written elsewhere about the content of the list of periti, this article will discuss how this list came to be: what are the unique challenges that come with researching 20th century Catholic records?

Although the Second Vatican Council (1962-5) is the most important religious event of the last century, it remains curiously underdocumented.

## Introduction

The landing page for the finished project is here:

I wrote about my findings at the New Liturgical Movement and The Pillar. 

> "The Periti of Vatican II: A New Research Project by Sharon Kabel." New Liturgical Movement (blog), January 25, 2023. https://www.newliturgicalmovement.org/2023/01/the-periti-of-vatican-ii-new-research.html#.Y9nIK3bMJPY

> "Documenting the 'experts' of Vatican II." The Pillar, April 11, 2023. https://www.pillarcatholic.com/p/documenting-the-experts-of-vatican

This essay is a summary of my research methods that led to those findings. 

In 1980, the Vatican published a list of 479 names - the 479 council periti at the Second Vatican Council. The list looked like this: 

![](/uploads/periti/index_peritorum.png "The list of periti as recorded by the Vatican")

So, each name was recorded as: 

> Lastname Latinized_first_name, AbbreviatedOrder
> 
> I, II, III, IV

My original plan was to OCR (optical character recognition) the document, copy and paste the list, and do some relaxing research deep dives into some of the periti. 

Unfortunately, from a researcher’s perspective, the formatting of this list renders this impossible. If I ran the list through OCR, the formatting prevented me from copying and pasting the names in a sequential way. The lack of the ‘vernacular’ first name meant I could not easily research by full name. In fact, I could not be sure what the first and last names actually were. There was no syntactical delineation between the names, except for a comma to set apart the (latinized and abbreviated) religious order. 

This list of names felt like a barrier to research itself, and I can't resist fixing a list.

## Literature Review

Regarding the periti generally, A great deal of literature has also been written on specific groups of periti. Works tend to focus on the nationality (the then-infamous _Squadra Belga_) or on religious orders (the Sulpicians may have the most careful documentation of their order’s role in the Council). There are also many more works on the periti, but not necessarily on their role as periti. Hans Kung, for example, is famous for many things besides his role at the Council.

My primary interest was in complete or partial lists of periti.

The core text for the council periti is:

> “Index Peritorum.” In _Acta synodalia Sacrosancti Concilii Oecumenici Vaticani II. Indices_, 937–49. Vatican City: Typis polyglottis Vaticanis, 1980.

To my knowledge, there is only one other freely available list of periti online: 

> Chow, Gabriel. “Periti of the Second Vatican Council.” GCatholic (blog). http://www.gcatholic.org/events/list/Vatican2-Periti.htm. The periti are organized by status - eventually pope, eventually bishop, priests, laicized, etc. - and alphabetically by last name. Each peritus’ country and flag are provided, and occasionally the peritus’ name at the time of the Council.

There are partial lists of periti in the following sources:
