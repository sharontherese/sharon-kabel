My birthday is this week, so I wanted to do a little data project that was more fun. 

Taylor Swift came out with a new album recently, and the number of colors mentioned in "Invisible Strings" inspired me to tabulate all of the colors she mentions in her music. So, eight albums later, here we have it! 

# Methods

I scanned the lyrics from Swift’s eight studio albums: _Taylor Swift_, _Fearless_, _Speak Now_, _Red_, _1989_, _Reputation_, _Lover_, and _Folklore_. 

I used a fairly strict definition of "color". The word itself didn’t count, nor did proper nouns (Snow White), anything elemental or light-related (dark, light, fireworks, neon, Christmas lights, shine, starry, glitter, glow, ultraviolet, rainbow), patterns (plaid), or color-adjacent words (rose garden, rose thorns, champagne, wine, hair bleached).

This left me with 12 colors: black, blue, gold, gray, green, orange, pink, purple-pink, red, tan, teal, and white. 

Swiftian scholars may take issue with my classification of “purple-pink” as its own color, but given the context of the song it seems to refer to one color, not two. Complaints may be directed to the songwriter.

One could also challenge “champagne sea” (“This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things,” _Reputation_), because of its Homerian undertones. While I am not currently swayed, I look forward to future research on both “champagne” and Swift’s iterations of “wine” and “rose.” 

I only counted lyrics once; i.e., “loving him was red” (“Red,” album of the same name) is counted as one occurrence, despite being used multiple times in the song. 

# Results

On those eight albums, I counted 74 individual instances of colors. The most common color, by far, is blue, followed by red and gold. 

There seems to be a turning point around _Red_, when both the quantity and variety of colors increase. 

Red, Lover, and Folklore, all have the most variety of colors; Lover may have the most interesting breakdown by color.
