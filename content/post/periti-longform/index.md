# Abstract

Although the Second Vatican Council (1962-5) is the most important religious event of the last century, it remains curiously underdocumented. It is surprisingly difficult to have an accurate and comprehensive picture of who was present, what was said, what was done, and what was meant. Even a complete list of the Council Fathers, the voting members of the Council, is difficult to find. Even more mysterious are the periti, the theological assistants to the Council itself and/or particular Council Fathers. These men, priests and religious, were selected for their expertise in numerous aspects of theology and history. They would go on to become university presidents, newspaper editors, radio directors, bishops, saints, criminals, and in one instance, pope. The amount they wrote in their careers is nearly immeasurable, and the more they are studied, the more we find their direct influence on the inception, discussion, revision, and promulgation of the Council documents themselves. For the first time, here is a list of the 479 council periti as reported by the Vatican, 49 private periti - with over 30 data points for each peritus. Those data points include 7 author identifiers, 7 biographical identifiers, and 11 points of general interest. While I have written elsewhere about the content of the list of periti, this article will discuss how this list came to be: what are the unique challenges that come with researching 20th century Catholic records?

# Introduction

The project started with a list. 

In 1980, the Vatican published a list of 479 names - the 479 official periti at the Second Vatican Council. Each name is formatted as: 

> Lastname Latinized_first_name, AbbreviatedOrder
> 
> I, II, III, IV

![](/uploads/periti/original_list.png " ")

From a researcher’s perspective, the formatting of this list renders it nearly useless. 

The lack of the ‘vernacular’ first name meant I could not easily research by full name. In fact, I could not be sure what the first and last names actually were. There was no syntactical delineation between the names, except for a comma to set apart the (latinized and abbreviated) religious order. Even if I ran the list through optical character recognition (OCR), the formatting prevented me from copying and pasting the names in a sequential way.

Given the variety of naming conventions from different countries and religious orders, this list of names was in fact a barrier to research itself. In order to do any research, I had to retype the list by hand. The rest of the project sprang from that.
