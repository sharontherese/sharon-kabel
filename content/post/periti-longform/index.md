# Abstract

Although the Second Vatican Council (1962-5) is the most important religious event of the last century, it remains curiously underdocumented. It is surprisingly difficult to have an accurate and comprehensive picture of who was present, what was said, what was done, and what was meant. Even a complete list of the Council Fathers, the voting members of the Council, is difficult to find. Even more mysterious are the periti, the theological assistants to the Council itself and/or particular Council Fathers. These men, priests and religious, were selected for their expertise in numerous aspects of theology and history. They would go on to become university presidents, newspaper editors, radio directors, bishops, saints, criminals, and in one instance, pope. The amount they wrote in their careers is nearly immeasurable, and the more they are studied, the more we find their direct influence on the inception, discussion, revision, and promulgation of the Council documents themselves. For the first time, here is a list of the 479 council periti as reported by the Vatican, 49 private periti - with over 30 data points for each peritus. Those data points include 7 author identifiers, 7 biographical identifiers, and 11 points of general interest. While I have written elsewhere about the content of the list of periti, this article will discuss how this list came to be: what are the unique challenges that come with researching 20th century Catholic records?

# Introduction

The project started with a list. 

In 1980, the Vatican published a list of 479 names - the 479 official periti at the Second Vatican Council. Each name is formatted as: 

> Lastname Latinized_first_name, AbbreviatedOrder
> 
> I, II, III, IV

![](/uploads/periti/original_list.png)

From a researcher’s perspective, the formatting of this list renders it nearly useless. 

The lack of the ‘vernacular’ first name meant I could not easily research by full name. In fact, I could not be sure what the first and last names actually were. There was no syntactical delineation between the names, except for a comma to set apart the (latinized and abbreviated) religious order. Even if I ran the list through optical character recognition (OCR), the formatting prevented me from copying and pasting the names in a sequential way.

Given the variety of naming conventions from different countries and religious orders, this list of names was in fact a barrier to research itself. In order to do any research, I had to retype the list by hand. The rest of the project sprang from that. 

# Literature Review

Regarding the periti generally, A great deal of literature has also been written on specific groups of periti. Works tend to focus on the nationality (the then-infamous Squadra Belga) or on religious orders (the Sulpicians may have the most careful documentation of their order’s role in the Council). There are also many more works on the periti, but not necessarily on their role as periti. Hans Kung, for example, is famous for many things besides his role at the Council. 

My interest was in complete or partial lists of periti.

The core text for the council periti is:

> “Index Peritorum.” In _Acta synodalia Sacrosancti Concilii Oecumenici Vaticani II. Indices_, 937–49. Vatican City: Typis polyglottis Vaticanis, 1980.

To my knowledge, there is only one other freely available list of periti online: 

> Chow, Gabriel. “Periti of the Second Vatican Council.” GCatholic (blog). http://www.gcatholic.org/events/list/Vatican2-Periti.htm. The periti are organized by status - eventually pope, eventually bishop, priests, laicized, etc. - and alphabetically by last name. Each peritus’ country and flag are provided, and occasionally the peritus’ name at the time of the Council.

There are partial lists of periti in the following sources:

# Materials and Methods

My materials were simple: a Zotero library, a Google Drive, and a keyboard.

With the Vatican’s list (hereafter AAS), I had no reliable pieces of uniquely identifying information. ‘Council sessions attended’ was unhelpful, except perhaps as a cross-reference once I found the peritus. ‘Religious order abbreviation’ helped, but only for the religious - and most periti were diocesan. Even among the religious, I had to figure out the Latin abbreviation. For example, the order Diocesan Workers (_“Sac. Op.”_ in the AAS list) got maddeningly mixed up with Dominicans (_"OP"_) and priests (_"sacerdote"_, abbreviated as _sac._ in many results). 

The Latinized first name proved to be a mixed blessing. The famous periti were easy - Ratzinger Ioseph is Joseph Ratzinger, Pope Benedict XVI. Even then, what counts as his “real” first name? Technically, it would be Josef, but is that how people would search for it?

Georgius could be George (American), Jorge (Chilean), Jacques-Georges (Syriac), Giorgio (Italian), or Georgi (Bulgarian). The last name might give me a clue - Estevez is probably not from Ireland - but I could never assume. A French-sounding name could come from France, Canada, Belgium, or any one of their mission territories. A Catholic priest is uniquely hard to pin down geographically, especially an order priest. He may have come from any country, been ordained anywhere, been assigned anywhere, studied anywhere, learned any language, or served any role.

So, I iteratively developed a list of author identifiers that linked the identifier(s) to the names on the AAS list. 

## Round 0: Retype

The project originally was going to be this stage only: a simple retyping of the Vatican’s list of periti into a spreadsheet. I quickly became dissatisfied with this, and expanded my scope to retyping, verifying, and expanding the data. 

## Round 1: Triage

What could find in a 1-minute search in a search engine and the Catholic News Archive? I searched their last name and possible first name. Names either accrued links - usually to Wikipedia pages, Google Books, or articles - or I flagged them as ‘unconfirmed.’ 

About 75 periti in, I realized that I should be tracking ‘country of origin’. That was the one piece of metadata I did my best to find for each peritus in Round 1. 

## Round 2: Enrich

This was the most time consuming round. I had grouped my list of 479 names into 3 subgroups: the obvious, the somewhat obvious, and the unconfirmed names. The more I searched, the more data points I found that I wanted to include. Choosing a new data point to collect meant going back through all previously searched periti to extract that information. 

Because I had ‘country of origin’ for most periti, I sorted by country (instead of alphabetically by last name for Round 1). I could more easily search similar sources and find patterns. French records behave differently than, say, Hungarian records, and I would search a bit differently for each of them. For example, most Wikipedia pages from most countries have a link out to Wikidata. The French Wikipedia does not interlink with Wikidata. For any French-looking names, I needed to search them separately in Wikidata. 

**IMAGE**

This round was extremely messy, and out of order. A lot of names that I thought I had confirmed had to be ‘demoted’ to unconfirmed. Sometimes what I thought I found was not substantial enough. For example, I did find an Arthur Gibson who was possibly a priest in the 20th century, but that’s not enough to connect him to my list. 

## Round 3: Polish 

This was a more fun, but still time consuming round. Most of it was spent standardizing the Selected Mention column, changing the data from links to a hyperlinked label (such as "Subject of book" or "Mentioned in article").

## Bonus Round 4: Check it all again

As I was cleaning up my Zotero references, I idly searched VIAF for one of my unconfirmed periti - and I found the right guy. I realized to my chagrin that I needed to re-check my unconfirmed names, now that I had a much better sense of how to search and what to look for. 

## Data points

Eventually, I settled on four groups of metadata I wanted to include for each peritus.

The core: the AAS list, retyped and corrected:

1. Last name
2. Latinized first name
3. First name
4. Order (if applicable)
5. Session I?
6. Session II?
7. Session III?
8. Session IV?

The author identifiers

9. Wikipedia: A Wikipedia page was the ideal identifier because of the level of information, and the degree of interlinking with other identifiers.
10. Wikidata: A Wikidata page was useful for finding other identifiers, and Wikipedia pages in other languages.
11. VIAF: VIAF’s ‘About’ section could tell me nationality, a Wikipedia page I may have missed, and variants of their name.
12. Worldcat Identities: Worldcat Identities could tell me variant names, books about them, books by them, years published, languages published, and holding institutions.
13. FindAGrave: FindAGrave could tell me birth place, burial site, year born, year died, and in some cases rich biographical detail not found in any other identifier.
14. Catholic Hierarchy: Catholic Hierarchy told me rank, birth year, death year, and dates ‘promoted’.
15. Selected mention: While many periti were verifiable through ‘traditional’ avenues - i.e. they wrote a book, so I can find them in catalogs and author lists - many periti left their mark in other ways. They may have written religiously for their diocesan newspaper. They may have been fiercely loved by their hometown. They may have a lecture series or golf tournament named after them. After a lot of deliberation, I decided to count these as their own identifiers. 

The biographical information 

16. Ethnicity/country of origin: I admit that I conflated country of origin and ethnicity, which led to occasional problems. For a priest who was born in America, I put “USA.” What about Luigi Ligutti, who was born in Italy, but emigrated to America? His archival collection and almost all of his priestly career was in America - rather famously, as he worked with rural American populations. What about Konrad Kernweisz? He was born in what is now Romania, but his name is clearly German - Banat Swabian, to be exact. All of this was complicated by the fact that any priest’s Wikipedia page or online tribute might be in any language and from any country. The final complicating factor was my stubborn ignorance on obvious cultural markers. I did my best to be consistent, and I sincerely hope I have not reignited any ethnic conflicts. I owe a great deal of thanks to my long-suffering husband, who has done his level best to remind me of esoteric historical details, like the existence of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
17. Birth year: Extracted from one or more of the identifiers. In case the numbers didn’t match, I used the most commonly used year.
18. Death year: Same as above.
19. Age at council: 1962 minus birth year.
20. Age at death: Self evident.
21. Highest episcopal title: Did they ever attain the rank of superior general, abbot, bishop, cardinal, or pope? I counted archbishops as bishops, and cardinal-deacons as cardinals.
22. Sainthood: Have they attained the rank of Servant of God, Venerable, Blessed, or Saint?

The extra stuff:

23. Important: Is this peritus famous in general, (such as Pope Benedict or Hans Kung) or was this peritus influential around the time of the Council (such as Georges Tavard, who may not be in the headlines now, but certainly was back then)?
24. Photo no reuse: I found lots of photos of periti, but the photos may be under copyright.
25. Photo reuse: I found a public domain photo on Wikipedia, Wikidata, or the Catholic News Archive.
26. Change during council: did the peritus die, or become a bishop (and therefore voting member of the council) during the council? There is one case of the reverse: John L. Swain, SJ, was appointed vicar general of the Jesuits (1960), was a Council Father during session III (September-November 1964), stepped down as vicar general (October 1964), and served as a peritus for session IV (September-December 1965).
27. Memoir on Vatican II: Did the peritus write a book or article on his time at the council?
28. Typo in original list: Was the peritus’ name misspelled in the Vatican’s list? The most egregious example is John Courtney Murray, who is listed as _Courtney, Murray_. The first name is missing entirely, and the names are out of order.
29. Credibly accused: This column only applies to American periti, as very few countries have conducted reviews of priests credibly accused of child sexual abuse. Of the few countries that have, their findings are only partially public. France, for example, had a gargantuan report on their abuse crisis, but nowhere can I find a publicly available list of the priests’ names. I checked American names in Pro Publica’s “Credibly Accused” database. Non-American periti are noted as “n/a”.
30. Sexual ethics watch: This column initially was to note the peritus’ stance on Humanae Vitae or contraception, but it expanded to capture a variety of stances. “Obedient” generally refers to public support of Humanae Vitae; “Disobedient” or a more detailed comment could refer to a ‘progressive’ stance on Humanae Vitae, Marian apparitions, women’s ordination, or liturgical reforms. In rare cases, I noted a criminal offense.
31. Left priesthood and/or married: Did the peritus leave the priesthood, and/or get married?
32. Notes: This column captures anything that I thought was important to know about the peritus, that was not captured by any other column. Because I am primarily interested in where the worked and what he was famous for. You will note I cared predominately about periti who worked at newspapers, journals, and publishers. 

Using FindAGrave as part of my research workflow did not occur to me until near the end of the project. Because it was near the end, I had to re-search every name. The silver lining is that I had so much information - so many identifiers, so many clues about the peritus’ life - that I could more effectively use FindAGrave’s simple search interface. It would have been hopeless to use FindAGrave, had I not had an idea about country of origin, birth year, and death year. 

This was an extremely iterative process. I might strike out on all identifiers, but then find a chance mention in Google Books or JSTOR - then I would re-search the identifiers and find a treasure trove. 

It was not until near the end of the entire project that I hit upon two of my best search tactics. What plagued me throughout the project was not being sure about the peritus’ first name. I might search 2-10 variations on a first name in WikiData, VIAF, or Worldcat Identities. What I learned (painfully) was that I can search last name first for many tools, and use autofill to save me minutes of agony. 

Searching VIAF for _Zalba, M_ and waiting briefly would reveal two autofilled entries: 

{{< hl >}}Zalba, Marcelino 1908-2008{{< /hl >}}.

> Zalba, Marcelino 1908-2008
> 
> Zalba, Marcelino, S.J

Both are connected to the same entry, our guy.

**IMAGE**

Last name + letter of first name, then waiting for autofill, is how I confirmed almost 3 dozen otherwise unfindable periti. 

My second dynamite strategy - less broadly applicable but for me more exciting - was to use OCR errors in my favor. OCR is how PDFs and documents are made searchable, so that we can CTRL+F or “Search inside” for a particular word. OCR is a powerful tool, but is only as good as the legibility of the text it’s scanning. 

Order priests were a challenge. Ostensibly, their order would make my life easier. There are many Thomas Gallaghers, but not many Thomas Gallaghers who are Dominicans (O.P., for Order of Preachers). However, not all identifiers and databases note the religious order. Those who do may not do so consistently, and if I search with the order - which term do I use, and am I positive that I’m not accidentally missing the right result? What if Dominican or OP is noted elsewhere in the record, but not in the field I’m searching? 

The Catholic News Archive would be an ideal database to search for this, were it not for the uncorrected OCR. By no means is this a complaint - the CNA is such a phenomenal tool, and anyone can log in and clean up the OCR. It’s simply a reality of searching. I would love to search “thomas gallagher OP,” but capital O’s are usually labelled incorrectly by OCR. 

So, I ev0lved. I tried the following search with great success: 

> “gallagher 0P”~1

That particular syntax is a proximity search: it means that I am searching the CNA for ‘gallagher’ and ‘0P’ within one word of each other. I found several relevant articles about a Thomas Gallagher. I went to VIAF, searched for Gallagher, T, waited for the autofill, and found him. 

Later, I used the same idea to search CNA for the Missionary Oblates of Mary: 0MI vs. OMI.

I cannot stress how iterative this searching was. If a name seemed common, then I would start with a narrow search tool, like the CNA. If the name was uncommon, I would throw it into Google Books, Wikidata, or another giant tool. 

I had great success adding “monsignor” or “msgr” to my periti names, as many of these priests were monsignors (a now defunct title). I might also add the language-appropriate version of council, rome, or vatican. Finding the right guy in one tool meant double checking all of the other identifiers, even if I had just looked. 

## Private periti 

Most periti were council periti; they were appointed by the Council to support a particular committee. Some Council Fathers were permitted to bring private periti. 

I found several dozen private periti by searching the CNA (and only the CNA) for “expert” or “peritus” during the years 1962-1965. Since publishing this project, I have had several readers email me about a private peritus I missed. Each name has been added to my spreadsheet.

# Results

Currently, the list contains 479 council periti and 49 private periti. 

Of the 479 council periti, I was able to find information about all but 19. 


# Discussion

## The catholicity of Catholicism

The missionary nature of the Church nullifies (or at least seriously complicates) the ability to make inferences based on names and geographical markers. A few examples: 

* **Luc Gillon** was Belgian but only has a Congolese Wikipedia page
* **Antoine Hacault** was a Canadian but only has a German Wikipedia page
* **Killian Flynn** was an Irish peritus who worked in Africa but only has a Polish Wikipedia page
* **Michael Hrynchyshyn**, ethnically Ukrainian but born in Canada, prompting a discussion with my husband about the Russian Civil War and Ukrainians emigrating to Canada in the 1920s
* **Adolfo Ledwolorz**, who I assumed was Polish, but all of his books were in German. I found a vita (in his own words) in a footnote on the Wikipedia page for his hometown. He went to school in Breslau. My husband patiently re-explained the German Empire to me.
* **William Onclin**, who went by a variety of first names, but mostly “Willy.” I assumed American, but in fact he was Belgian, but he only has a Spanish Wikipedia page. Because of my initial scarce results, I assumed he was a minor figure. Once I searched under “Willy,” I found a lecture series and book series named after him, and one article described his work on “sweeping changes in the Code of Canon Law.”
* **Jaroslav Mala** was Croatian, born in Yugoslavia, but only has a Hungarian Wikipedia page.
* **Konrad Kernweiss**, whom I assumed was German, kept appearing in Romanian books. My husband explained the Transylvania Saxons and the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
