The 16 Carmelites martyrs of Compiegne have become famous not only for their martyrdom, but for singing while at the scaffold.

William Bush, in his book _To Quell the Terror: The Mystery of the Vocation of the Sixteen Carmelites of Compiègne Guillotined July 17, 1794_, draws from eyewitness accounts and archival material to describe what exactly the sisters sang.

The first song to note is a parody of **_La Marseillaise_**, written by one of the sisters, and sung when the sisters were in prison awaiting trial. A partial translation from Bush's book is below:

> _Let our hearts be giv'n to joyfulness
> The day of glory now is here!
> Let us banish all of our weakness,
> We can see that the cross now is near!
> Let's prepare ourselves for the victory!
> Let us each as a conqueror go forth!
> Under the cross, God's great banner,
> Let's all run, let's all fly toward glory!
> Let our ardor be enflamed!
> Let's give our bodies in his Name!
> Let's climb, let's climb, the scaffold high!
> We'll give God the victory!_

Once they were loaded into carts to be taken to the guillotine, they likely sang the [**Office for the Dead**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Elx_iOWpHg) (they were very likely chanting the Divine Office throughout their imprisonment as well), 

**Psalm 51**...

> _Miserere mei, Deus: secundum magnam misericordiam tuam. Et secundum multitudinem miserationum tuarum, dele iniquitatem meam...._
>
> _Have mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness. According to the multitude of thy mercies, do away mine offenses…_ 

the **_Salve Regina_**...

> _Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ,  
> vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve.  
> Ad te clamamus exsules filii Hevæ,  
> Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes  
> in hac lacrimarum valle.  
> Eia, ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos  
> misericordes oculos ad nos converte;  
> Et Jesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui,  
> nobis post hoc exsilium ostende.  
> O clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria._
>
> _Hail, holy Queen, Mother of Mercy,  
> Hail our life, our sweetness and our hope.  
> To thee do we cry,  
> Poor banished children of Eve;  
> To thee do we send up our sighs,  
> Mourning and weeping in this valley of tears.  
> Turn then, most gracious advocate,  
> Thine eyes of mercy toward us;  
> And after this our exile,  
> Show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus.  
> O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary._

and possibly Vespers and Compline (the trial had been that morning, the verdict that afternoon; the execution happened in the evening). 

Some two hours later, at the foot of the scaffold, they sang the [**_Te Deum_**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXTlQMD9Qrs).

> _Te Deum laudamus, te Dominum confi temur.  
> Te aeternum Patrem omnis terra veneratur.  
> Tibi omnes Angeli, tibi caeli et universae Potestates.  
> Tibi Cherubim et Seraphim incessabili voce proclamant:  
> Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus Dominus Deus Sabaoth.  
> Pleni sunt caeli et terra majestatis gloriae tuae.  
> Te gloriosus Apostolorum chorus,  
> te Prophetarum laudabilis numerus,  
> te Martyrum candidatus laudat exercitus.  
> Te per orbem terrarum sancta confi tetur Ecclesia.  
> Patrem immensae majestatis;  
> venerandum tuum verum et unicum Filium;  
> Sanctum quoque Paraclitum Spiritum.  
> Tu rex gloriae, Christe.  
> Tu Patris sempiternus es Filius.  
> Tu, ad liberandum suscepturus hominem, non horruisti Virginis uterum.  
> Tu, devicto mortis aculeo, aperuisti credentibus regna caelorum.  
> Tu ad dexteram Dei sedes, in gloria Patris.  
> Judex crederis esse venturus.  
> Te ergo quaesumus, tuis famulis subveni, quos pretioso sanguine redemisti.  
> Aeterna fac cum Sanctis tuis in gloria numerari._
>
> _We praise thee, O God: we acknowledge thee to be the Lord.  
> All the earth doth worship thee: the Father everlasting.  
> To thee all Angels cry aloud: the Heavens, and all the Powers therein.  
> To thee Cherubim and Seraphim: continually do cry,  
> Holy, Holy, Holy: Lord God of Sabaoth;  
> Heaven and earth are full of the Majesty: of thy Glory.  
> The glorious company of the Apostles: praise thee.  
> The goodly fellowship of the Prophets: praise thee.  
> The noble army of Martyrs: praise thee.  
> The holy Church throughout all the world: doth acknowledge thee;  
> The Father: of an infinite Majesty;  
> Thine adorable, true: and only Son;  
> Also the Holy Ghost: the Comforter.  
> Thou art the King of Glory: O Christ.  
> Thou art the everlasting Son: of the Father.  
> When thou tookest upon thee to deliver man: thou didst not abhor the Virgin’s womb.  
> When thou hadst overcome the sharpness of death: thou didst open the Kingdom of Heaven to all believers.  
> Thou sittest at the right hand of God: in the glory of the Father.  
> We believe that thou shalt come: to be our Judge.  
> We therefore pray thee, help thy servants: whom thou hast redeemed with thy precious blood.  
> Make them to be numbered with thy Saints: in glory everlasting._

As the sisters mounted the scaffold, they sang [**_Veni Creator Spiritus_**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TwdoT2D_50)...

> _Veni, Creator Spiritus,  
> mentes tuorum visita,  
> imple superna gratia  
> quae tu creasti pectora.	  
> Qui diceris Paraclitus,  
> altissimi donum Dei,  
> fons vivus, ignis, caritas,  
> et spiritalis unctio.	  
> Tu, septiformis munere,  
> digitus paternae dexterae,  
> Tu rite promissum Patris,  
> sermone ditans guttura.	  
> Accende lumen sensibus:  
> infunde amorem cordibus:  
> infirma nostri corporis  
> virtute firmans perpeti.	  
> Hostem repellas longius,  
> pacemque dones protinus:  
> ductore sic te praevio  
> vitemus omne noxium.	  
> Per te sciamus da Patrem,  
> noscamus atque Filium;  
> Teque utriusque Spiritum  
> credamus omni tempore.	  
> Deo Patri sit gloria,  
> et Filio, qui a mortuis  
> surrexit, ac Paraclito,  
> in saeculorum saecula._
>
> _Come, Holy Ghost, Creator blest,  
> and in our hearts take up Thy rest;  
> come with Thy grace and heav'nly aid,  
> To fill the hearts which Thou hast made.  
> O Comforter, to Thee we cry,  
> Thou heav'nly gift of God most high,  
> Thou Fount of life, and Fire of love,  
> and sweet anointing from above.  
> O Finger of the hand divine,  
> the sevenfold gifts of grace are thine;  
> true promise of the Father thou,  
> who dost the tongue with power endow.  
> Thy light to every sense impart,  
> and shed thy love in every heart;  
> thine own unfailing might supply  
> to strengthen our infirmity.  
> Drive far away our ghostly foe,  
> and thine abiding peace bestow;  
> if thou be our preventing Guide,  
> no evil can our steps betide.  
> Praise we the Father and the Son  
> and Holy Spirit with them One;  
> and may the Son on us bestow  
> the gifts that from the Spirit flow._

and Psalm 117, [**_Laudate Dominum omnes gentes_**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DXmooVV5Tg). 

> _Laudate Dominum, omnes gentes; laudate eum, omnes populi.  
> Quoniam confirmata est super nos misericordia ejus, et veritas Domini manet in aeternum._
>
> _Praise the Lord, all ye nations!  
> Praise Him all ye people!  
> For His mercy is confirmed upon us, and the truth of the Lord endures forever._
