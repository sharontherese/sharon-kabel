<h1 class="title">Video and highlights from an aristocratic traditional
Catholic wedding</h1>
<p class="date">2024-01-18</p>
</header>
<p>On the morning of July 6, a bride and groom prepared for their
traditional Catholic wedding. The photographer and videographer were on
hand to document an historic union of two Catholic families. The groom
may even have had custom wedding booklets with the ceremonies in Latin
and English, to assist the many guests who had never been to such old
ceremonies.</p>
<p>The year was 1905, and the couple was John Crichton-Stuart and
Augusta Mary Monica Bellingham.</p>

<p>The father of the groom, the 3rd Marquess of Bute, deserves an
article in his own right, which I cannot provide here. Here is a
memoir<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> of one of his Benedictine friends,
and a more recent biography<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> of Crichton-Stuart III).
John Chrichton-Stuard, was not only the richest man in the world at the
time, but the first English translator of the Roman Breviary.<a

class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> The
father of the bride was Sir Alan Henry Bellingham, who among other
roles, served as Private Chamberlain to Popes Pius IX, Leo XIII, and
Pius X.</p>
<p>Setting that aside…the most interesting thing about this wedding is
that, despite being more than 100 years ago, we have wedding video
footage, and a connection to a uniquely printed wedding booklet!</p>
<h1 id="the-wedding-film">The Wedding Film</h1>
<p>The National Library of Scotland has generously made available this
historic film - likely the only film of its kind.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/bute/bute_video.jpg"
title="Screenshot from the National Library of Scotland" /></p>
<p>From the Library’s record:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Curator’s Note: This is a personal wedding film - a record for the
participants of their happy event. Nothing unusual in that except for
its date - 1905. This was the era of the itinerant showman and the
entrepreneur who would run picture shows at the fairground and music and
variety halls. It would be another five years before purpose built
cinemas - picture palaces - start to appear…The aristocracy rarely
engaged with cinema in this period…This then makes this film
particularly interesting. An aristocratic couple engaging a film company
to record their nuptials. It is - we think - one of the earliest - if
not the earliest family wedding film in this country. It would be
another 20 years before the first generation of home movie cameras came
into use, and it pre-dates the cinema newsreel when celebrity weddings
would be filmed for the news.</p>

<h1 id="the-wedding-booklet">The Wedding Booklet</h1>
<p>The couple may have distributed copies of a wedding booklet, “The
Marriage Service with the Mass for a Bridegroom and Bride.” The booklet
was about 40 pages, and contained the English (and some Latin) for the
wedding rite and the wedding Mass.</p>
<p>While I can’t be sure that the Butes had copies on hand, I believe
that this booklet is worth mentioning because of its connection to the
Bute family.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/bute/program_1.jpg" title="Cover page" /></p>
<p><img src="/uploads/bute/program_2.jpg"
title="Note to the present edition: The translation from the Latin in the present edition of the Marriage Service has been taken with permission from a version privately printed by the late Marguess of Bute and that of the Nuptial Mass has been revised with much help from a translation from the same pen." /></p>
<p>The Marquess in question is the groom’s father, The Third Marquess,
who died in 1900. There are three dates connected to the booklet: the
preface is dated 1895, the nihil obstat and imprimatur are 1905, and
‘note to the present edition’ is 1909). It seems reasonable to infer
that the Third Marquess had this wedding booklet printed privately in
1895, and then there was at least one subsequent edition that was made
more publicly available via the publishers Art &amp; Book Company in
London.</p>
<p>I collect wedding booklets of this kind (see my scanned collection
here<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>), so here are a few highlights I
noticed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nihil obstat: Hamilton Macdonald, founder of the Guild of
St. Stephen, for “rais[ing] the standard of altar serving”<a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></li>
<li>Preface: John Alphonsus Maria Morrall, OSB, author of <em>Saints of
the Order of S. Benedict</em><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></li>
<li>The Gloria and the Credo are both included in the wedding Mass. At
different times in the history of rubrics, both were excluded from the
wedding Mass, so to see both in print and ’nihil obstat’d is unusual.
Perhaps my history is incomplete!<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></li>
